    1. INTRODUCTION</span>  <br><br>
Pawsitive aims to create loving homes for stray animals and foster meaningful bonds 
between animals and humans, free of cost. We believe that every pet deserves a happy, 
healthy life, enriching the lives of their owners. Notably, our project is proudly developed 
with zero budget. <br> <br><span class="head">
1.1 Significance of the Project </span> <br><br>
Our project addresses the need to provide a new lease on life to stray animals while 
combating loneliness and depression in individuals. Pets have the remarkable ability to 
bring joy and companionship during difficult times, making our endeavor significant. <br></p></div>
<span class="head"> 2. OBJECTIVE </span><br> <br>
* Facilitate the adoption of stray animals, including dogs, cats, and cows, by providing a 
digital platform connecting potential owners with new furry friends. <br>
* Serve as a comprehensive resource hub for pet owners, offering tips, advice, and support 
on pet care and street/local breed pet adoption. <br>
* Mitigate the risks of road accidents and struggles for survival faced by stray animals by 
providing them with a safe and caring environment. <br><br><span class="head">
3.METHODOLOGY </span><br><br>
Our methodology for developing the Pawsitive website primarily revolves around utilizing HTML, 
CSS, and JavaScript within Visual Studio Code for coding purposes. For design, we heavily relied 
on Figma, an intuitive design tool known for its collaborative features and ease of use. 
To enhance user interaction and engagement, we incorporated AI functionalities, including 
ChatGPT, Blackbox, and BARD by Google. These AI technologies empower the website with 
intelligent features, enabling seamless communication and providing users with valuable 
assistance throughout their journey on the platform. <br>
Throughout the development process, we extensively utilized online resources such as Google 
and Stack Overflow to address technical challenges, seek solutions, and broaden our 
understanding of web development principles. Additionally, we actively engaged with the Figma 
open-source community, leveraging its wealth of resources, templates, and design assets to 
enhance the visual appeal and usability of the website. <br>
Furthermore, we embraced a continuous learning approach by leveraging educational platforms 
like YouTube. Through tutorials, walkthroughs, and instructional videos, we honed our skills in 
web development, design principles, and AI integration, ensuring that our website meets the 
highest standards of functionality and aesthetics. <br>
By employing this methodology, we aimed to create a user-centric website that not only facilitates 
stray animal adoption but also promotes responsible pet ownership. Through the seamless 
integration of technology, design, and AI, we endeavored to deliver an enriching and impactful 
online experience for both users and their furry companions. <br><br>
